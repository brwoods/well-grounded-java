# Chapter 15 - Advanced functional programming

## `Ch15`

This directory contains multiple examples showing various functional
programming concepts.

This entire directory can be loaded in an IDE at the `Ch15` level. Java 11+ is
required.

* `ch15/Ch15Examples.java` - Basic examples from the text
* `ch15/ClosureExamples.java` - Basic examples of closing over a value
* `ch15/DepositMain.java` - Example of reflective access to classes
* `ch15/PrefixerMain.java` - Example of a functional string prefixer
* `ch15/StreamExamples.java` - Example of using function chaining on streams
* `ch15/TailRecASM.java` - TODO: Fix or delete
* `ch15/TailRecNaive.java` - Example of tail recursive function which still fails

Alternatively, the samples may be compiled and run at the command-line as
follows:

```
cd Ch15/ch15
javac *.java
java -cp .. ch15.Ch15Examples
```
